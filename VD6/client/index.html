          <p>In this exercise, we have a parallel tag cloud visualization to show all the documents from 1989 to 2016. Our LDA model extracted 5 topics for each document, and in each topic, we used only the top 5 words. On the bottom side, we show the year and the president. Additionally, we represent the party with a logo and color. We have two interactions built into the visualization. First, the user can hover on a word, and all the other words will be faded out. Second, by clicking on any word, the visualization will lock the hover state on that word, and the user can click anywhere outside the word to change the state.</p>
